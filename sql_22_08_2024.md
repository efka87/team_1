3. Calculate total Sales by City and Pet Kind

```

4. Calculate Average sales by City

SELECT Owners.City, AVG(Procedures.Price) AS AvgSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Owners.OwnerID = Pets.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
