# Team 1 or as we like to call ourselves - Almost drowning 
Team 1 repository

 ## Our team leader is Evln.

 Our team does not have any previous experience with Java, but a few of us have some experience in Python. 

Team members descriptions:
 KKatariin - I am more confident in Python than Java, because I have previously worked in Python. At the moment (6.07.2024) I have understood everything, but writing code myself is harder of course. I think I am managing quite well and thankfully am a quick learner.

 Evln - I have been working in IT field for several years, have experience in working in teams but most of the time in Customer Success team. 
 I have some experience in Python as I have learned it on my own. Java for me feels difficult. 
 Other than that I have learned some basics in C#. And some more knowledge in SQL, as I use it almost daily in my current job.

 Ruth - I enjoy Pythons clarity, but in Java it is harder to make mistakes (that's good). I'm still waiting for the cogwheels in my head to set right and the time I truly understand all the abstractions. Right now I understand, but cannot do it myself - hence time and practice is needed.
 I really enjoyed a talk with one senior developer (a friend) who explained programming related things to me by drawing them in the air and I saw the imaginary images - that gives me hope!

Nelet - With no previous experience in programming I feel that this course is challenging, but I’m intrigued to learn and know more about this field.
I’m a team player and have worked with many people during my career. Hoping to became a programmer, but need to learn and practice a lot more!
