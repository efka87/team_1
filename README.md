Team 1 repository

 ## Our team leader is Evln.

 Our team does not have any previous experience with Java, but a few of us have some experience in Python. 

Team members descriptions:
 KKatariin - I am more confident in Python than Java, because I have previously worked in Python. At the moment (6.07.2024) I have understood everything, but writing code myself is harder of course. I think I am managing quite well and thankfully am a quick learner.
